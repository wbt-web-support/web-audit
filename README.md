## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+project+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://supabase.com/projects/project/_?showConnect=true)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## State Management (Redux Toolkit)

This project uses [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for global state management.

- The Redux store is set up in `app/store.ts`.
- The store is provided to the app in `app/layout.tsx` using the `Provider` from `react-redux`.
- To add new global state, create a slice (see Redux Toolkit docs) and add its reducer to the `reducer` field in `store.ts`.
- Use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from `react-redux` in your components to access and update state.

Example usage:
```tsx
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from '@/app/store';

const value = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.example.value);
const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
```

## Performance Analysis with Google PageSpeed Insights

This project now supports automated performance analysis using the [Google PageSpeed Insights API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rest/v5/pagespeedapi/runpagespeed).

### Setup

1. **Get a Google PageSpeed Insights API Key:**
   - Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/pagespeedonline.googleapis.com).
   - Enable the PageSpeed Insights API for your project.
   - Create an API key and copy it.
2. **Set the API Key in your environment:**
   - Add the following to your `.env.local` or deployment environment:
     ```
     PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

### Usage
- When running an audit, include `"performance"` in the `analysis_types` array in the POST body to `/api/audit-projects/[id]/analyze`.
- The backend will fetch performance data from Google PageSpeed Insights in parallel with other analyses.
- Results are stored in the `performance_analysis` field of the `audit_results` table and returned in the API response.

### Notes
- The API supports both mobile and desktop strategies (currently defaults to mobile).
- You must have a valid API key set for performance analysis to work.
- See [Google's API documentation](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rest/v5/pagespeedapi/runpagespeed) for more details on the response format.

## New Feature: All Links Analysis

- The backend now collects all internal and external links from every crawled page and stores them in the `audit_projects.all_links_analysis` field (JSONB).
- Each link includes: `href`, `type` (internal/external), anchor text, and the page URL where it was found.
- The dashboard UI displays a summary and a table of all unique links found during the crawl, similar to the image analysis section.
- Migration: a new column is added to the `audit_projects` table for this feature.

## Feedback and issues

Please file feedback and issues over on the [Supabase GitHub org](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/new/choose).
